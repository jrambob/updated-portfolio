            <p>My name is Julian Rambob. I am currently a student at UC Davis and an aspiring full-stack web developer. My studies in Linguistics and Computational Cognitive Science has ignited my interest in web development. Although I utilize various computational models and theories in my studies, I realized how few practical coding and programming skills I had. That's when I decided I needed to supplement my theoretical education.

            <p id="p2">I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at the UC Davis Extension school.

            <p>
               Some of my passions and areas of interest are: computational linguistics, speech patterns/pathology, formal languages, Physical Symbol Systems and Neural Network Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Cognition Modeling, as well as Syntax and Semantics. All of these areas give me a unique approach to computers and therefore web development. My assortment of knowledge in Cognition and Linguistics often directly applies to various elements of Compute Sciences and one day I hope to posses enough knowledge and skill to begin appllying the theories in my field to the world of technology.
